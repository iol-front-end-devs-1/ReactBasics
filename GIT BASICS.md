## Termoinologies
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Branch
- a version of a repository
- a repository can have many branches (eg. master/main, feature, development)

<br>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checkout
- means switching between to different versions of a repository

<br>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clone
- copy or CLONE a repository to your machine

<br>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commit
- a commit is a collection of: 
  - content
  -  a message about how you got there 
  -  and the commits that came before it. <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/git-terminology">source</a>

- a snapshot of the project's staged changes. <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit#:~:text=The%20git%20commit%20command%20captures,you%20explicitly%20ask%20it%20to.">source</a>
  
- As a noun: A single point in the Git history; the entire history of a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word "commit" is often used by Git in the same places other revision control systems use the words "revision" or "version". Also used as a short hand for commit object. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43970559/what-is-exactly-meaning-of-commit-command-in-git">source</a>

- As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the projectâ€™s state in the Git history, by creating a new commit representing the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at the new commit. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43970559/what-is-exactly-meaning-of-commit-command-in-git">source</a>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Git <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/">source</a>
- Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. 
- Git is a Distributed Version Control System. 
- Git helps you keep track of the changes you make to your code. It is basically the history tab for your code editor(With no incognito mode ?).

<br>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repository 
- a collection of cource code

<br>


### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staging Area <a href="https://dev.to/sublimegeek/git-staging-area-explained-like-im-five-1anh">source</a>
- the <ins>staging area is like a box</ins> where you can put stuff into it and take stuff out of it.
  - any change you make becomes a thing that is outside of the box
  - before you want to execute <ins>git commit</ins>, you have to put things inside of that box.

<br>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version Control
- Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. So ideally, we can place any file in the computer on version control. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/">source</a>
